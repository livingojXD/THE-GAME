The plan is realistic, scalable, and aligned with industry standards used by mid-sized SLG studios.  The goal is to deliver a server-authoritative, live-service mobile game with city building, world map, alliances, PvE, PvP, and monetization.  Team Structure (7 People) Producer / Game Designer  Owns vision and feature decisions  Writes and maintains the Game Design Document (GDD)  Designs economy, progression, events, and monetization  Controls scope and milestones  2–3. Unity Client Developers (2)  Implement city systems, UI, animations  Build world map rendering  Integrate SDKs (IAP, analytics)  Optimize performance for mobile  4–5. Backend / Server Developers (2)  Design server architecture  Implement authentication, save systems  Handle combat calculations  Build alliance, chat, mail systems  Ensure server authority and anti-cheat  Game Artist / UI Designer  Creates buildings, heroes, dragons  Designs UI/UX and icons  Produces store and marketing art  Maintains visual consistency  QA / Live Ops  Tests builds and tracks bugs  Balance testing  Event configuration  Player support tools  Patch verification  Technology Stack Client  Unity (C#)  Addressables  ScriptableObjects  Android first, iOS later  Backend  Java (Spring Boot) or Node.js  REST APIs + WebSockets  Server-authoritative logic  Database  MySQL or PostgreSQL (persistent data)  Redis (timers, fast access)  Infrastructure  AWS or Google Cloud  Docker  CDN for assets Core Game Systems  City building with upgrade timers  Resource production and storage  Heroes and dragons with skills and progression  Tile-based world map  PvE monsters and camps  PvP combat with server-side simulation  Alliances (chat, help, roles)  Events, daily quests, VIP  Monetization via IAP bundles and speed-ups  Development Philosophy  Server is always authoritative  Client never decides outcomes  Economy validated in spreadsheets  Weekly internal playtests  Analytics-driven decisions  Scope control is critical First 90-Day Day-by-Day Roadmap (Summary) Days 1–14: Pre-Production  Vision alignment  GDD creation and approval  Economy and combat design  Tech architecture finalized  UI wireframes and art style locked  Days 15–30: Offline Core Prototype  City building and upgrades  Resource systems  Timers and progression  Local save/load  Basic PvE combat  Unity project fully playable offline Days 31–45: Server Integration  Account system  Server-side timers  Resource validation  Combat calculation on server  Anti-cheat rules  Online city builder MVP  Days 46–60: World Map & PvE  Tile-based world map  March system  Monster camps  Fog of war  Performance optimization  PvE world map MVP  Days 61–75: Social Systems  Alliance creation and management  Alliance chat and help  Mail and notifications  Moderation tools  Stress testing  Days 76–90: Polish & Alpha Preparation  Analytics integration  Tutorial and onboarding  Daily quests and event framework  UI and audio polish  Closed alpha build  Internal testing and stabilization  Outcome After 90 Days  By Day 90, the team has:  A server-authoritative city builder  A functional world map with PvE  Alliance and social core  Analytics and live-ops foundation  A closed alpha–ready build  This foundation allows safe expansion into PvP, monetization, and large-scale live operations in months 4–12.
